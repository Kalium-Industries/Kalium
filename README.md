## FAQ

#### How many alts can I use at a time?

This completely depends on how powerful your computer is, Kalium is able to use as many alts as you need, just add them into the alts table. If you are struggling on running a lot use preformance mode!

#### Will preformance mode impact the alts?

This is a yes/no situation, preformance mode won't limit your alts, but if their fps is too low or high to handle, just use the setfps command.

#### Will Kalium become Open Source?

In the future it is planned to fully open source Kalium, but during the beta testing periods Kalium will be closed source and obfuscated.


## Support

Common issues:

- Error Code 647: No chatmode found | Fix: Try rejoining if the game is using a supported chatmode, otherwise the game is not supported.

- Testing Mode Enabled: This means that testing mode is enabled in the config and will not run Kalium | Fix: Disable testing mode.

- Error Code 787: Error loading Kalium | Fix: Let it rejoin and re-execute, if it continues to happen wait for Kalium to update.
